## Motivation

I created this project as a way to practice my C# skills and learn more about file handling and serialization. I wanted to create a simple and fun application that allows me to create my own quizzes with different categories, questions, and answers. The application features a user interface, a quiz category class, a question class, and a file utility class.

## Technologies

I used the following technologies, tools, and frameworks to create this project:

- C# as the programming language
- Visual Studio 2019 as the integrated development environment
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 as the software framework
- System.Console as the console input and output class
- System.Random as the random number generator class
- System.Collections.Generic.List as the generic list class
- System.Xml.Serialization as the XML serialization class
- System.IO.File as the file input and output class

Some of the challenges or difficulties that I faced and how I overcame them are:

- Creating a quiz category class to store the name and the questions of the category. I used a public string property for the name and a public list of question objects for the questions.
- Creating a question class to store the inquiry, the answers, and the correct answer index of the question. I used public string properties for the inquiry and the answers and a public int property for the correct answer index.
- Creating a file utility class to serialize and deserialize the quiz category and the questions to and from an XML file. I used the XmlSerializer class to create and write the XML file and the File class to read and load the XML file.
- Shuffling the answers to create a random order for each question. I used a for loop to swap the elements of the list of answers with a random index.
